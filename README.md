# Hex

Hex is a web application that I built using HTML, CSS and jQuery that will generate a random colour and provide you with the HEX and RGB for that colour. It will also change the background colour of the website and the styling of all the elements on that page change based on the colour.

## Explanation of JS files
### customHex.js
This file enables the app to change the style and value of the RGB to the equivalent of the HEX. This will only be triggered if the user enters their own HEX.

### customRGB.js
This file enables the app to change the style and value of the HEX to the equivalent of the RGB. This will only be triggered if the user enters their own RGB.

### randomColour.js
This file will generate a random RGB that is then used to set the background colour and style the elements on the page.

### rgb2hex.js
This file converts a RGB value into a HEX value.
